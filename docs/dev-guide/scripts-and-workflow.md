| `pnpm test:e2e` | Run E2E tests under `test/e2e/` in real VS Code environment |
| `pnpm test:e2e:update` | Run E2E tests and update all snapshots |
| `pnpm test:fixture` | Run string extraction fixture integration tests (only runs reliably in GitHub Actions; may fail locally due to VS Code instance timing issues) |

### Release

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm release` | Full release flow: build → bump patch version → package vsix |
| `pnpm release:patch` | Bump patch version with standard-version and push tags |

## Daily Development Workflow

### 1. Start Development Environment

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Then press `F5` in VS Code to launch the Extension Development Host.

### 2. Test After Code Changes

```bash
pnpm test:unit

# If snapshot-related logic changed, update snapshots
pnpm test:update
```

### 3. Package and Install Locally

```bash
pnpm vsce:pack

# Install to current IDE
code --install-extension ./i18n-ally-community-*.vsix --force
```

### 4. Submitting a Pull Request

When submitting a PR, please ensure you use the provided Pull Request template and meet the following requirements:

1. **AI Assistance**: Clearly state the proportion of AI-generated/assisted code.
2. **Type**: Specify whether the PR is a `fix` (bug fix) or `feat` (new feature).
3. **Examples & Tests**:
   - If adding a new framework or feature, provide relevant examples and unit/e2e tests.
   - If fixing a bug, add a reproducible fixture in `examples/by-fixtures/issue-<n>` and a corresponding E2E test in `test/e2e/fixtures/issue-<n>`.
4. **Documentation**: Update the relevant documentation in `docs/` if your PR changes any user-facing features or developer guidelines.

### 5. AI PR Review (GitHub Copilot)

We recommend using GitHub Copilot to assist in the PR code review workflow.

After submitting a Pull Request, maintainers can assign **Copilot** as a reviewer to automatically analyze the PR, ensure it meets our contribution guidelines, and check for any potential issues.

### 6. Release a New Version

```bash
pnpm release
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Values | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `I18N_ALLY_ENV` | `production` / `development` / `test` | Controls build mode and runtime behavior |
| `CHAI_JEST_SNAPSHOT_UPDATE_ALL` | `true` | When set, running tests will auto-update all snapshots |
